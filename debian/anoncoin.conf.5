.TH ANONCOIN.CONF "5" "March 2014" "anoncoin.conf 0.8.5.6"
.SH NAME
anoncoin.conf \- anoncoin configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
All command-line options (except for '\-generatei2pdestination', '\-datadir' and '\-conf') may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration
file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.
.PP
The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character.
.PP
The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, \fBanoncoind\fR(1) will look for a file named \fBanoncoin.conf\fR(5) in the anoncoin data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the
'\-datadir' and '\-conf' command-line arguments.
.SH LOCATION
anoncoin.conf should be located in \fB$HOME/.anoncoin\fR
