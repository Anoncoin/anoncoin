# The Anoncoin core primary gitignore file...
#
# The entries that follow are specific to building Anoncoin and it's toolchain, as well
# as running tests and various other core code activities.
# A few are for future structural changes to v10 core technology, that could otherwise be
# left out at this time.
#
# The challenge has been to get this list correct for building on the different platforms,
# initially this refers to linux, mingw32 on windows, and darwin on the mac.
#
# If your building with VisualStudio, running an IDE like Eclipse or Code::Blocks please
# add your entries, above or below this group.  As well, other types of non-standard tools.
#
# Core developers working on a subcomponent are welcome to include entries here, or use
# your subfolder and create an ignore list, specifically for your project.
#
# As this file is a work in progress, newly discovered items missing from the list are
# encouraged to be added, if your in a hurry, throw it at the bottom, for later organizing.
